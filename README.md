## final results
(5 apr 2024) 
due to a variety of factors (including misinterpretation of registration information, delays in robot production, lack of time for organiser to make adjustments), we were unable to participate in the 2024 Singapore Robocup Open.

throughout the past year, we've learnt a lot about the workings of a robocup bot, and we'll be back next year to finally prove our worth

we're currently working to finish up and polish our bot, such that we can run a few scrim games before starting anew with our bot for the 2024-2025 season.

## remarks
* everything here is half cooked spaghetti
    * we spent a lot of our time this year trying to figure things out, so a lot of stuff here is the result of trial and error
    * i guess our learning can be shown through the different versions, but theres many many areas which have a lot of potential for improvement
* version control
    * we didn't really use our github repository that much, which is a really bad practice
    * furthermore, one of our members has still not figured out how version control works, and consistently asks me to "help (him) push the code"
